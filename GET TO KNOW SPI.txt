SPI, a four-wire serial interface developed by Motorola, offers several advantages:
	- Supports full-duplex communications.
	- Often used for data transfer between a smart device (master) and peripheral devices (less smart).
	- Higher speed than UART/I2C.

In SPI, there is one master and one or more slaves.
Basic SPI components include:

1. CS (Chip Select):
Chooses the communication target.
2. SCLK (Synchronous Clock):
Provides timing and synchronization.
3. MOSI (Master Out Slave In): 
Data transmitted by the master.
4. MISO (Master In Slave Out): 
Data received by the master.


Keep in mind:
1. Clock signal is generated by the master; slaves do not require their own clocks, even when transmitting data.

2. In multi-slave configurations:
One way to communicate with a bunch of slaves is to have a different CS for each one. All other lines are shared.
Another way is Cooperative Slaves, where there is only a CS line and a shared clock.

3. The slave has no way of sending data to the master on its own.


Clock/Data Specifics
There are 4 mode in SPI protocol, each one specifiy a different CPOL(Clock Polarity - the default value of the clock when the data line is IDLE) and a CPHA (Clock Phase - which edge of the clock data is sampled (rising/falling)
Clock Polarity of 0:
____________________--__--__--__--__--________
				IDLE|				  |IDLE
